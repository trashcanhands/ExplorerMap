# Explorer's Map
Explorer's Map is a TurtleWOW quest marker add-on alternative to ones like pfUIQuest that automatically add all markers of any chosen type.  
This add-on is all about the spirit of exploration while still allowing players a way to keep track of Quest Givers (and their quest offerings).

## INSTRUCTIONS
