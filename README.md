# Explorer's Map
Explorer's Map addon for TurtleWOW


Explorer's Map is a TurtleWOW quest marker add-on alternative to ones like pfUIQuest that automatically add all markers of any chosen type.

This add-on is all about the spirit of exploration while still allowing players a way to keep track of Quest Givers (and their quest offerings).

=====INSTRUCTIONS=====

Speak to a Quest Giver and select a quest (to view the Quest Text) to create a '!' icon on your World Map with a tooltip indicating
the NPC's name, location, and Available Quests, which will include the selected quest.

  * Selecting available quests from an NPC this way will add each one to the '!' icon tooltip.
  * ACCEPTING an available quest will move the quest from the '!' icon tooltip's Available Quests to Active Quests.
  * ACCEPTING all available quests from a Quest Giver will change the '!' from gold color to red, to signify at a glance that all of the quests from that Quest Giver have been accepted.
  * Abandoning an Active Quest will return the quest back to the '!' icon tooltip's Available Quests and reverting the icon back to a gold color.

Upon completion of all Active Quests from a Quest Giver (that has no remaining Available Quests listed), the '!' icon will then be removed from your World Map.
