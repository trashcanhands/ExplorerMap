# Explorer's Map
Explorer's Map is a quest marker add-on alternative for vanilla World of Warcraft

This add-on is all about embracing exploration while still allowing players a way to keep track of Quest Givers (and their quest offerings)

## INSTRUCTIONS

```
/explorer gui - Open the Quest Givers window--same as the minimap button
/explorer refresh - Refreshes map's quest givers from database
